## Setup/Installation Requirements

  1. Click on the *clone or download* button of this repository. You can download the project file clicking the **"Download Zip"** button, double clicking the file in downloads, and navigating to the index.html file and double clicking that. *Or*, you can copy the link that pops up when you've clicked the *clone or download* button above this README.md file.
  2. Navigate to your terminal, where you have previously installed git (if you have not done this yet, go ahead and do so now).
  3. In terminal, change your directory to desktop, and then type **git clone https://github.com/**.
  4. When you've pressed enter, my project will be cloned onto your desktop, and now you can change directory into it and type **"code ."** to open the projects files in Visual Studio Code!

_Next, install npm in the project directory_

5. At the root directory for this project, enter the command "npm install"
6. Open the contents of the directory in a text editor or IDE of your choice (e.g., to open the contents of the directory in Visual Studio Code, enter the command "code ." in the Terminal).
7. Open index.html in a browser of your choice (e.g., Google Chrome).

_Installing you're own API key:_
1. generate your individual API key by signing up for one on [this website](https://developer.betterdoctor.com/)
2. Place your new API in an .env file at the top level of your directory (which you will create through either the terminal by changing directory intp the project and typing 'touch .env' or through right clicking over the project name on the left-heand side of VSCode interface and typing .env). Set it equal to what you'll call it by later- spelling and capitialization all identical. For example, I called it by ${process.env.API\_KEY}, so in my .env file its looks like 'API_KEY = xxxxxxxxxx', where the x's are my key. for your convenience, just set the API reference to the same format in your .env file so you dont have to change it in the doctors.js file.
